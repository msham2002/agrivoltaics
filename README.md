## Project Abstract
The Ai Assisted Farming Drone project aims to provide smallholder farmers with affordable and adaptable monitoring technology to enhance agricultural productivity, using the monitoring of grape crops in Ohio's vineyards as a case study. In partnership with OMID USA, the project addresses the limitations of traditional agricultural drones by providing a scalable solution tailored for smallholder farmers. Utilizing the MicaSense RedEdge-MX™ multispectral camera and Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB), the system integrates multispectral imaging and AI analytics to detect diseases such as downy mildew, powdery mildew, black rot, and lantern flies.
The drone focuses on a X650 Holybro Drone kit while ensuring compatibility with other farming equipment, like tractors, to maximize flexibility for farmers. The project also involved collaboration with the Control Box team to integrate stationary sensors for a comprehensive monitoring solution. The solution focuses on being simple, affordable, and flexible, supporting OMID USA’s mission to help underserved farming communities.
